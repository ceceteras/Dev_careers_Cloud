# TASK 2.

We believe you already know the basics of git and how to collaborate with your colleagues before you get to this point. 

In this task, we will create virtual servers from different operating systems and install nginx on them, this would help us understand how a webserver works, operational use of basic cloud tools, linux OS, IAAS operations and cloud networking principles. 

To begin, 

- You need to create an account with a Cloud Service Providers.
 
You can create an [Aws account(free tier 1 year)](#https://aws.amazon.com/free/?trk=ce1f55b8-6da8-4aa2-af36-3f11e9a449ae&sc_channel=ps&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!433803620870!e!!g!!aws%20free%20tier&ef_id=CjwKCAjwwL6aBhBlEiwADycBICrd7WzV5tqajQAozKcflcBJX9KlNOtXhTqUQOQa4y1tqgJmYiyHGhoCiNEQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!433803620870!e!!g!!aws%20free%20tier&all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all).
 Other options would be, azure (free for a few months) or a GCP account as well. 

 - Next, create a windows and Linux virtual machine respectively, each of these machines should have RDP and SSH privileges. 

 - In both machines, install [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/install/) server. 
 (Would be nice if you can spice it up by deploying a simple application running on any random port (eg: 3000) via Nginx on port 80)

- Share server public IP address on the team whatsapp group
